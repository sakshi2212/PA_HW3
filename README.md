# Breast Cancer Survivability Prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model to classify breast cancer patients based on survivability outcomes using feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Structure
- **Step 1: Preprocessing** – Includes data loading, outlier detection, missing value imputation, encoding, scaling, and feature selection.
- **Step 2: Modeling** – Trains multiple machine learning models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network.
- **Step 3: Hyperparameter Tuning** – Performs hyperparameter tuning on selected models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) using Grid Search.
- **Step 4: Results** – Displays performance metrics for each model and identifies the most important features in classification.

## Results
- The best models for predicting breast cancer survivability were **Gradient Boosting** and **Random Forest**, achieving high accuracy and F1 scores.
- Important features identified included **Survival Months**, **Age**, and **Regional Node Examined**, aligning with real-world expectations.
